# Using VIKUS Viewer to visualize photos in HKUST Digital Images

[HKUST Digital Images](https://digitalimages.hkust.edu.hk/) contains over 30,000 photos of the early University events from 1988 to the early 2000s. Here is the source code to show how we used [VIKUS Viewer](https://github.com/cpietsch/vikus-viewer) to visualize these photos.
